Task 1 — Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP).
The goal of this task is to build a machine learning model that can classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

based on their sepal and petal measurements.

📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets in machine learning.
In this project, I performed:

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Model training

Model evaluation

Prediction on sample input

This task helped me understand the complete ML workflow from start to finish.

📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains:

150 rows

4 input features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

3 output classes (species)

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

I trained and compared multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Finally, I selected the best-performing model based on accuracy.

📈 Model Accuracy

The model achieved high accuracy during testing, showing strong performance on unseen data.


This task strengthened my understanding of machine learning basics and model-building techniques.
It also helped me practice data analysis, visualization, and classification algorithms.
